# Eucalypt

This is the primary repository for the *eucalypt* tool for generating
and transforming structured foramts like YAML and JSON.

It is for documentation, standard prelude, reference test cases and a
test harness for implementations.

One prototype implementation is in the early stages of development at
https://github.com/curvelogic/eucalypt-hs. The beginnings of some
documentation at https://curvelogic.github.io/eucalypt/ describe a
mixture of what `eu` can do now and what it will do eventually.
