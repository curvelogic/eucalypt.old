<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> Eucalypt is in an
experimental phase of development. Much of this does not yet exist.
The introduction is here to act like a product specification, guiding
development. It is highly subject to change and perpetually at risk of
destruction. In short, go away and come back later. </span></p>

<h1 id="the-philosophy-behind-eucalypt-the-language">The philosophy behind Eucalypt (the language)</h1>

<p>Eucalypt, the language, is unorthodox in many respects - probably
moreso than you might realise on first acquaintance.</p>

<p>Many people have deep-seated and inflexible opinions about programming
languages and language design <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and will likely find something in
here that they have a kneejerk reaction against.</p>

<p>However, the design is not unprincipled and, while it is experimental
in some respects, I believe it’s internally consistent. Several
aspects of the design and the aesthetic are driven by the primary use
case. Maybe by exploring some of the inspiration and philosophy behind
the language itself, I can head off potential criticism.</p>

<h2 id="accept-crypticality-for-minimal-intrusion">Accept crypticality for minimal intrusion</h2>

<p>Eucalypt is first and foremost a <em>tool</em>, rather than a language. It is
intended to replace generation and transformation processes on
semi-structured data formats. Many or most uses of Eucalypt the
language should just be simple one-liner tags in YAML files, or maybe
eucalypt files that are predominantly data rather than manipulation.</p>

<p>The Eucalypt language is the depth behind these one-liners that allows
Eucalypt to accommodate increasingly ambitious use cases without
breaking the paradigm and reaching for a general purpose scripting
language. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The pre-eminence of one-liners and small annotations and “logic
mark-up”, means that Eucalypt often favours concise and cryptic over
wordy and transparent. This is a controversial approach.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Eucalypt logic should “get out of the way” of the data. Templating
is attractive precisely because the generating source looks very
like the result. Template tags are often short (with “cryptic”
delimiters - <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{}}</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;%= %&gt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">[| ]</code>…) because these are “marking
up” the data which is the main event. At the same time, the tags are
often “noisy” or visually disruptive to ensure they cannot be
ignored. Eucalypt via operator and bracket definitions, picks and
chooseS from a similar palette of expressive effects to try and be a
sympathetic cohabitee with its accompanying data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many cases where it makes sense to resist offering an
incomplete understanding in favour of demanding full understanding.
For example, it is spurious to say that <code class="highlighter-rouge">bind(x, f)</code> gives more
understanding of what is going on than <code class="highlighter-rouge">x &gt;&gt;= f</code> - unless you
understand the monad abstraction and the role of bind in it, you
gain nothing from the ideas that the word <code class="highlighter-rouge">bind</code> conveys when trying
to understand program text.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eucalypt just plain ignores the notion that program text should be
readable as English text. This (well motivated) idea has made a
resurgence in recent years through the back door of internal DSLs
and “fluent” Java interfaces <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. There is much merit in languages
supple enough to allow the APIs to approach the natural means of
expression of the problem domain. However, problem domains
frequently have their own technical jargon and notation which suit
their purpose better than natural language so it cuts both ways.
Program text should be approachable by its target audience but that
does not mean it should make no demands of its target audience.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These stances lead directly to several slightly esoteric aspects of
Eucalypt that may be obnoxious to some:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Eucalypt tends to be operator-heavy. Operators are concise (if
cryptic) and the full range of unicode is available to call upon.
Using operators keeps custom logic visually out of the way of the
data whilst also signposting it to attract closer attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eucalypt lets you define your own operators and specify their
precedence and associativity (which are applied at a relatively late
stage in the evaluation pipeline - <em>operator soup</em> persists through
the initial parse). There are no ternary operators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For absolute minimal intrusion, merely the act of placing elements
next to each other (“catenation”), <code class="highlighter-rouge">x f</code>, is meaningful in Eucalypt.
By default this is pipeline-order function application, but blocks
and lists can be applied as functions to make common
transformations, like block merge, very succinct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For even more power, Eucalypt lets you alter the meaning of
concatenation via <em>idiot brackets</em> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. This is inspired by the
<em>idiom brackets</em> that can be used to express applicative styles in
functional programming <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. These also provide an acceptable proxy
for ternary and other operators too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An equivalent generalisation of Eucalypt block syntax to provide a
capability similar to Haskell’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">do</code> notation might follow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cohabitation-of-code-and-data">Cohabitation of code and data</h2>

<p>Just like templates, Eucalypt source (or Eucalypt-tagged YAML or JSON)
should be almost entirely data.</p>

<p>The idea behind Eucalypt is to adopt the basic maps-and-arrays
organisation philosophy of these data formats but make the data
<em>active</em> - allowing lambdas to live in and amongst it and operate on
it and allowing the data to express dispositions towards its
environment by addition of metadata that controls import, export, and
execution preferences.</p>

<p>Eucalypt therefore collapses the separation of code and data to some
degree. You can run <code class="highlighter-rouge">eu</code> against a mixture of YAML, JSON and eucalypt
files and all the data and logic appears there together in the same
namespace hierarchy. The namespace hierarchy just <em>is</em> the data.</p>

<p>However, code and data aren’t unified in the sense of Lisp for
instance. Eucalypt is not homoiconic. The relationship is more like
cohabitation; code lives in amongst the data it operates on but is
stripped out before export.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Eucalypt is heavily inspired by Lisp and aims for a
similar fluidity though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lazy evaluation (encompassing uses of Lisp macros which control
evaluation order - if is)</li>
  <li>economical syntax and syntactic reinterpretability (idiot brackets)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Eucalypt values simplicity in the sense of fewer moving parts (and
therefore, hopefully, fewer things to go wrong). It values ease of
use in the sense of offering a rich and powerful toolkit. You may
not think it achieves either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eucalypt values familiarity more in the “shallower” parts of the
language where it only requires a couple of mental leaps for the
average programmer in these areas - (ab)use of catenation being the
key one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, Eucalypt shouldn’t be ashamed of its dusty corners. Dusty
corners are areas where novices and experts alike can get trapped
and lose time but they’re also rich seams for experimentation,
innovation and discovery<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. If you have to venture too far
off-piste to find what you need, we’ll find a way to bring it onto
the nursery slopes but we won’t close off the mountain.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

passages in The Lord of the Rings; they give a tremendous sense of
the depth of the world, that everywhere you look there is a rich
